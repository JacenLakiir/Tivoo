- [Estimated] 10 hours

Estimate evaluation:
- ??? ******** last person gets to fill this in **********

Discussed with:
- UTA Mason Meier (assigned UTA)

Resources:
- Gagawa library (http://code.google.com/p/gagawa/)

Files Used to Start and Test:
- none

Data / Resource Files Required:
- various XML files (included in the data folder)
- gagawa-1.0.1 JAR (included in the lib folder)

Impressions:

Input portion:
Messing with Calendar is somewhat annoying. Also, our current code style is not the best, but this is only the prototype. Other than that, it wasn't especially hard.

??? (FILTERING)

Output portion:
Creating the appropriate directories and files and generating HTML for the output stage took some experimentation, especially in terms of using the Gagawa library, but overall prototyping the output stage was a fairly straightforward process.
